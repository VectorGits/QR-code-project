### What I learned

I learned to add box shadows to divs, to give them the card illusion. It's pretty easy, yet it has a wonderful effect.

```html
<div class="card">Card content</div>
```
```css
.card {
  box-shadow: 0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), 0 6px 20px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.19);
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_shadows_box.asp) - This helped me with Box shadows. I really liked this information and will use it going forward.
- [Resource 2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1952256/how-to-center-horizontally-div-inside-parent-div) - This is an amazing answer on StackOverflow which helped me learn to center a div in another div. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
